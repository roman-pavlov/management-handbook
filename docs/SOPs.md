## My standard operation procedures
This document focuses on how I normally operate.

### Communication and collaboration
If you have a request, I'd appreciate your input, suggestions and questions. This is a good starting point for our discussion. I normally ask questions to navigate the topic. It's good when you have >1 solutions of the problem in mind. It would reduce our effort and become an exercise of validating the solutions rather than designing them. But it's OK, if you don't. Note, I might have less expertise in the topic. In this case, please take my opinions with this in mind.

For non-trivial topics, I prefer to have an artifact (e.g. doc) to work with. If you write a short statement/ memo with a context and thoughts, It would greatly help those working on it. I like a mix of asynchronous discussion over an artifact and live one (e.g. white boarding).

At times, I ask the managers in my team to have updates in writing following a standard template. When I work with multiple work streams and teams, a more structured approach works pretty well for both myself and the managers.

### Feedback
I give feedback during 1:1s or when it's the right time. When I do it, I share specific examples of your behaviour I'd like to see more of. And any specific examples of your behaviour I'd like to see less of.

### Meetings
I aim to start and finish meetings on time as I respect our time. 

If I am invited to a meeting it means you need my input or share something with me. If I see an invite with an unclear agenda and I haven't got any context I get upset and tempted to decline (not a fan of "surprises"). The last thing I want is to spend time in a meeting that is generally irrelevant or is a matter of a simple update. I aim to be clear about the purpose of my meetings as well.

I expect you to be present in a meeting. If you are bored or feel excluded, it's a good thing to reflect on why and potentially discuss in 1:1.

#### 1:1s
It's our time to work together on your career. They are typically 30 min every week.
I offer to drive the agenda to make sure you get the most out of it. I will use this meeting to give feedback, unblock you, work on your goals, and help with anything you need help with.

I propose to have a shared document where we both can put agendas and take notes and action items. So we can remember what we worked on.
