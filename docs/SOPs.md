## My Standard Operating Procedures
This document outlines how I typically operate to foster effective collaboration, streamline decision-making, and create a productive work environment.

### Communication and Collaboration
If you have a request, I appreciate your input, suggestions, and questions. This provides a solid starting point for discussion. I usually ask clarifying questions to better navigate the topic. It helps if you have more than one solution in mind, as this reduces effort and shifts the focus to validating solutions rather than designing them. However, if you don’t, that’s okay. Please note that I may have less expertise in the topic, so consider my opinions with this in mind.

For non-trivial topics, I prefer to have an artifact (e.g., a document) to work with. Writing a short statement or memo with context and thoughts greatly helps those involved. I value a mix of asynchronous discussion over an artifact and live discussions (e.g., whiteboarding).

At times, I ask the managers in my team to provide written updates following a standard template. When working with multiple work streams and teams, a structured approach benefits both me and the managers.

### Feedback
I provide feedback during one-on-ones or at appropriate moments. When giving feedback, I share specific examples of behaviors I’d like to see more of and those I’d like to see less of.

### Meetings
I aim to start and finish meetings on time out of respect for everyone’s time.


I appreciate a clear agenda making it productive.

I expect active collaboration in meetings. If you feel bored or excluded, it’s important to reflect on why and potentially discuss it in a one-on-one.

#### One-on-Ones
This is our dedicated time to work on your career. These meetings are typically 30 minutes long and occur weekly.

I encourage you to drive the agenda to ensure you get the most out of our time. I use these meetings to provide feedback, help unblock you, support your goals, and assist with anything you need.

I suggest maintaining a shared document where we can both add agenda items, notes, and action points. This helps us keep track of what we’ve discussed and worked on.
