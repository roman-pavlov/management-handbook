## Why this readme
Hello and welcome to my README! If you are here, you are probably curious.
By writing this document I want you to help to understand how to work with me in the best possible way. I use this as an opportunity to share a bit more about my values, role, expectations, ways of working etc. I care about work I do and people I work with. I hope this document will help to establish a lasting and productive collaboration.

## My Values
Philosophically, I lean towards the liberal views with a high-level
of autonomy/freedom in decision-making. My ideal target engineering organisation 
would be highly autonomous, and collaborative with a bottom-up culture being able 
to move fast and innovate. Sometimes it's a journey to get there. My mission is 
to help. I avoid being authoritarian at all costs unless things have been 
significantly broken.

I value transparency and collaboration between people. True teamwork unlocks 
the best results. Collaboration should be over ego.
Creating an environment of inclusion where different views on the same problem 
help to find the truth is important. I believe in the blameless 
culture where people can learn from their mistakes.

I value operational efficiency and DevOps culture. Shipping 
iteratively and quickly and getting things done are important. It helps to get quick feedback and improve. I like the motto: working smart and not hard.

And having a fun place to work is important. We spend way to much time at work and being serious. I tend to forget about it but aspire to bring more fun. I value sustainable work/life balance.

## My role
As a people leader, my role is:
- to set clear performance expectations and reduce uncertainty
- to trust you do the job in an efficient way and not to do your job for you
- to make sure you are unblocked and have the resources you need to succeed
- to share the context and known constraints so you can make the best decisions
- to create the environment for your personal growth
- to nurture an environment of innovation and collaboration
- to champion your accomplishments across the organisation and challenge you in 
ways that will help you grow

As an engineering leader, my role is:
- to align and set clear expectations of what good looks reflecting our organisational and company KPIs
- to help to improve our engineering culture. So we can work smarter and not harder
- to make sure the team and I deliver on promises we make
- to make sure the team have a good vision and a strategy for how to get there taking
into account the context and the company strategy

As a business partner, my role is:
- to be transparent on what we can/cannot deliver
- to be collaborative and approachable
- to build a reliable and trustworthy relationship
- to deliver a good outcome

## Expectations (my and yours)
**Best effort**. I trust and expect you to give your best effort and version on the job. I do the same. We all have different days. Some just don't work out. That's OK. Please expect that we can work together to have a reasonable workload and deadlines considering the time to take care of yourself. If you cannot give the best of yourself for any reason, I would be happy to discuss this and find ways forward.

**Setting expectations**. I do my best to communicate the importance, context and desired outcome and allow you to find out what works best for you and the team.

**Bias for action**. I support healthy ambition, proactiveness and initiative. According to the book "Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions" by Chip and Dan Heath, most of our decisions are easily reversible. In software engineering, it's very true. An environment of experimentation and learning from mistakes is important. Good decisions consider wider context, goals and constraints. My role is to enable this. I am accountable for my decisions and expect the same from the team.

**Stick to promises**. If I see risks in delivering a promise, I will let you know in advance. I expect the same from the team. Things may not go as planned. We are humans and sometimes tend to overcommit (including myself). The key is how we handle and communicate our challenges.

**Mutual help and support**. If you are stuck, just reach out. If I am not available for any reason, I will let you know why and when I am available. Help me to understand the urgency of the issue by describing the impact. There can be truly urgent things. For those, let's agree on the communication channels and SOPs in advance. Ideally, those should not be managed manually/ depend on someone's immediate presence. I expect **high collaboration and mutual support** in the team and between the teams. I like to say: there is no my or your work. There is our work! And we are in the same boat: we all either reach the shore or sink.

**No "Surprises"**. I prefer you bring up issues sooner. It would give time for mitigation. If this is your area of responsibility, I expect a plan of how you are handling it and what support (if any) is required. In any case, I want to avoid hearing bad news about our product or the team from external people, e.g. customers.

Inclusivity/ mutual support. Us first.

## The ways I work
If you come with a problem or a request, I appreciate your thoughtful input, suggestions and questions. This is a good starting point for a discussion. I will ask questions to navigate our discussion. I might have less expertise in a topic than you. In this case, I avoid sharing my opinions and redirect you to an expert.


### The power of feedback
I believe feedback is like a heartbeat. It's an essential part of our daily work. It should be given swiftly, clearly, and kindly. Any genuine feedback is good. It proves that someone cares and trusts. I value any feedback coming my way and would be happy to share mine.

I like to give feedback during 1:1s or when it's the right time. When I do it, I share specific examples of your behaviour I'd like to see more of. And any specific examples of your behaviour I'd like to see less of.

At times, I tend to forget about positive feedback and working to improve it. Sometimes, I ask you to write down what you are doing to help me out. It helps to recall the important and amazing work done and be an advocate of your work in the wider organisation.
