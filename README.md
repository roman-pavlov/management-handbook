## Why This Readme
Hello and welcome to my README! If you are here, you are probably curious.
I’d like to help you understand how we can collaborate effectively.

## About Me
I am a Ukrainian who has been living and working in the UK since 2015. I love building cool products that help people live better lives. I have a wife, a daughter, and a dog. I enjoy yoga, travelling, martial arts, music, motorcycling, sports, and many other things in life.

## My Values
I support liberal views and believe in a high degree of freedom in decision-making. My ideal engineering organisation is autonomous and collaborative, with a bottom-up culture that enables fast movement and innovation. Getting there is a journey, and my mission is to help. I avoid being authoritarian unless things are significantly broken.

I value transparency and collaboration over ego. True teamwork unlocks unexpected results. Creating an environment where diverse opinions contribute to finding the truth is important. I advocate for a blameless culture where people learn from their mistakes.

I value operational efficiency and DevOps, as they enable iterative and rapid shipping. I believe in working smart, not just hard.

Creating a fun workplace is important. We spend a significant amount of time at work being serious, and I aspire to bring more enjoyment into our environment. I support a sustainable work-life balance.

I believe in the culture of writing. Writing helps people refine their thinking and reduces misinterpretation and miscommunication.

I value feedback that is given both ways—swiftly, clearly, and kindly. If you feel uncomfortable sharing feedback with me directly, please feel free to speak to my manager.

I believe in having useful, concise, and productive meetings that respect our time.

I value in-person collaboration as it improves decision-making and accelerates the flow of information. For example, I find pair programming to be an effective collaborative technique that can significantly enhance team velocity when done well. At the same time, I also value focused work and the opportunity to work independently. A hybrid work setting offers a good balance.

## My Role
As a people leader, my role is to:
- Set clear performance expectations and reduce uncertainty.
- Trust you to do your job efficiently and not do it for you.
- Ensure you are unblocked and have the necessary resources.
- Share context and constraints so you can make informed decisions.
- Create an environment that fosters personal growth.
- Champion your accomplishments across the organisation.

As an engineering leader, my role is to:
- Set expectations that align with our company goals.
- Shape our engineering culture to improve how we work.
- Ensure we deliver on our commitments.
- Establish a vision and strategy to guide our progress.

As a business partner, my role is to:
- Be transparent about what we can and cannot deliver.
- Be collaborative and approachable.
- Build reliable and trusting relationships.
- Deliver results.

## Expectations
**Best effort.** I trust and expect you to give your best effort at work, and I will do the same. We all have off days, and that’s okay. We can work together to manage workloads and deadlines while ensuring you take care of yourself. If you are unable to give your best for any reason, let’s discuss it and find a way forward.

**Bias for action.** I encourage healthy proactiveness. According to *Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions* by Chip and Dan Heath, most decisions are reversible. In our day-to-day work, this is often true. I support the motto: "Act, learn, improve." This approach fosters a culture of experimentation. With decisions comes accountability. I take responsibility for mine and expect the same from you.

**Keeping commitments.** If I see risks in delivering on a promise, I will inform you as soon as possible, and I expect the same from you. Things don’t always go as planned—we are human and sometimes overcommit (myself included). The key is how well we handle and communicate challenges.

**Mutual help and support.** If you are stuck, reach out. If I am unavailable, I will share my availability. Help me understand the urgency of the issue by describing its context and impact. Some issues are genuinely urgent, and ideally, we should have standard operating procedures for those. I expect high collaboration and mutual support within and between teams. This is our strength. There is no *my work* or *your work*—it is *our work*. We are in the same boat: we either reach the shore together or sink together.

**No surprises.** I prefer to hear about issues sooner rather than later, as this allows time for mitigation. If an issue falls within your area of responsibility, I expect a plan for how you are handling it and what support (if any) is needed. I want to avoid learning about problems with our product or team from external sources, such as customers. In return, I will ensure you are not caught off guard by surprises from me.

## Personality Quirks
I tend to lean towards introversion and sometimes need space and time to think.

At times, I may come across as direct due to my Eastern European background. If this happens, please take it as a sign that I care, and feel free to share any feedback with me.

Some people have mentioned that they were unsure about my stance on a topic. If this ever happens, don’t hesitate to ask me directly for clarification.

If I seem too serious, a random English joke usually helps!
