## Why this readme
Hello and welcome to my README! If you are here, you probably are curious.
By writing this document I want you to help to understand how to work with me in the best possible way. I use this as an opportunity to share a bit more about my values, role, expectations, ways of working etc. I care about work I do and people I work with. I hope this document will help to establish a lasting and productive collaboration.

## My Values
Philosophically, I lean towards the liberal views with a high-level
of autonomy/freedom in decision-making. My ideal target engineering organisation 
would be highly autonomous, and collaborative with a bottom-up culture being able 
to move fast and innovate. Sometimes it's a journey to get there. My mission is 
to help. I avoid being authoritarian at all costs unless things have been 
significantly broken.

I value transparency and collaboration between people. True teamwork unlocks 
the best results. Collaboration should be over ego.
Creating an environment of inclusion where different views on the same problem 
help to find the truth is important. I believe in the blameless 
culture where people can learn from their mistakes.

I value operational efficiency and DevOps culture. Shipping 
iteratively and quickly and getting things done are important. It helps to get quick feedback and improve. I like the motto: working smart and not hard.

And having a fun place to work is important. We spend way to much time at work and being serious. I tend to forget about it but aspire to bring more fun. I value sustainable work/life balance.
