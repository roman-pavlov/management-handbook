## Why This Readme
Hello and welcome to my README! If you are here, you are probably curious.
I want to help you to understand how we can work in the best possible way.

## Briefly About Myself
I am Ukrainian, living and working in the UK since 2015. I love building cool products that help people to live better lives. I have a wife, a daughter and a dog. I enjoy yoga, travelling, martial arts, music, motorcycling, sports and many other things in life.

## My Values
Personally, I support liberal views and a high level of freedom in decision-making. My ideal engineering organisation would be autonomous, and collaborative with a bottom-up culture being able to move fast and innovate. It's a journey to get there. My mission is to help. I avoid being authoritarian unless things have been significantly broken.

I value transparency and collaboration over ego. True teamwork unlocks unexpected results. Creating an environment where different opinions help to find the truth is important. I value a blameless culture where people learn from their mistakes.

I value operational efficiency and DevOps. It enables shipping 
iteratively and quickly. I prefer working smart and not hard.

Having a fun place to work is awesome. We spend much time at work being serious. I tend to forget about it and aspire to have more fun. I support sustainable work/life balance.

I believe in the culture of writing. When people write they improve their thinking. Also, writing reduces the room for misinterpretation and miscommunication.

I value feedback that is given swiftly, clearly, and kindly coming both ways. If you feel uncomfortable sharing feedback with me directly, please feel free to speak to my manager.

I believe in having useful, short and productive meetings and value our time. 

I value in-person collaboration. It improves the decision-making process and speed of information. For example, I find pair programming an efficient collaborative technique. It may greatly improve team velocity if done well. At the same time, I value focus time and an opportunity to work solo. Certain tasks require focus time. Hybrid work setting is a good mix.

- Radical Candor by Kim Scott
- The Art of Action by Stephen Bungay
- Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard P. Rumelt

## My Role
As a people leader, my role is:
- to set clear performance expectations and reduce uncertainty
- to trust you do the job in an efficient way and not to do your job for you
- to make sure you are unblocked and have the resources you need
- to share the context and known constraints so you can make the best decisions
- to create the environment for your personal growth.
- to champion your accomplishments across the organisation

As an engineering leader, my role is:
- to set expectations of what good looks reflecting our organisational goals
- to influence our engineering culture in a way we can work smarter
- to make sure the team and I deliver on promises
- to make sure the team has a vision and a strategy for how to get there

As a business partner, my role is:
- to be transparent on what we can/cannot deliver
- to be collaborative and approachable
- to build a reliable and trusting relationship
- to deliver

## Expectations
**Best effort**. I trust and expect you to give your best effort on the job. I will do the same. We all have different days. Some just don't work out. That's OK. We can work together on a reasonable workload and deadlines considering the time to take care of yourself. If you cannot give the best of yourself for any reason, I would discuss this and find ways forward.

**Bias for action**. I encourage healthy proactiveness. According to the book "Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions" by C. and D. Heath, the most of our decisions are reversible. In our day to day, it's very true. I support the motto: "Act, learn, improve" The approach maintains an environment of experimentation. With a decision comes accountability. I am accountable for my decisions and expect the same from you.

**Stick to promises**. If I see risks in delivering a promise, I will let you know ASAP. I expect the same from you. Things may not go as planned. We are humans and sometimes tend to overcommit (including myself). The key is how well we handle and communicate our challenges.

**Mutual help and support**. If you are stuck, just reach out. If I am not available for any reason, I will share my availability. Help me to understand the urgency of the issue by describing its context/impact. There can be genuinely urgent things. For those, ideally we should have standard operation procedures. I expect high collaboration and mutual support in the team and between the teams. This is our power. There is no my or your work. There is our work! And we are in the same boat: we all either reach the shore or sink.

**No "Surprises"**. I prefer you bring up issues sooner. It would give time for mitigation. If this is your area of responsibility, I expect a plan of how you are handling it and what support (if any) is required. I want to avoid hearing bad news about our product or the team from external people, e.g. customers. From my side, I make sure you have no surprise from me.

## Personality Quirks
I am leaning towards introverted people and sometimes need space and time to think.

At times, I may be a bit direct as I have a footprint of the Eastern European culture. If it happens, please take my directness as a sign that I care and let me know any feedback.

Some people said they were not clear about my stance on a topic. If this is the case, please don't hesitate to ask for feedback explicitly.

If my look is a bit serious in a situation where it shouldn't, the best way to change would be to make a random English joke.
