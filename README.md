## Why this readme
Hello and welcome to my README! If you are here, you are probably curious.
By writing this document I want you to help to understand how to work with me in the best possible way. I use this as an opportunity to share a bit more about my values, role, expectations, ways of working etc. I care about work I do and people I work with. I hope this document will help to establish a lasting and productive collaboration.

## My Values
Philosophically, I lean towards the liberal views with a high-level
of autonomy/freedom in decision-making. My ideal target engineering organisation 
would be highly autonomous, and collaborative with a bottom-up culture being able 
to move fast and innovate. Sometimes it's a journey to get there. My mission is 
to help. I avoid being authoritarian at all costs unless things have been 
significantly broken.

I value transparency and collaboration between people. True teamwork unlocks 
the best results. Collaboration should be over ego.
Creating an environment of inclusion where different views on the same problem 
help to find the truth is important. I believe in the blameless 
culture where people can learn from their mistakes.

I value operational efficiency and DevOps culture. Shipping 
iteratively and quickly and getting things done are important. It helps to get quick feedback and improve. I like the motto: working smart and not hard.

And having a fun place to work is important. We spend way to much time at work and being serious. I tend to forget about it but aspire to bring more fun. I value sustainable work/life balance.

## My role
As a people leader, my role is:
- to set clear performance expectations and reduce uncertainty
- to trust you do the job in an efficient way and not to do your job for you
- to make sure you are unblocked and have the resources you need to succeed
- to share the context and known constraints so you can make the best decisions
- to create the environment for your personal growth
- to nurture an environment of innovation and collaboration
- to champion your accomplishments across the organisation and challenge you in 
ways that will help you grow

As an engineering leader, my role is:
- to align and set clear expectations of what good looks reflecting our organisational and company KPIs
- to help to improve our engineering culture. So we can work smarter and not harder
- to make sure the team and I deliver on promises we make
- to make sure the team have a good vision and a strategy for how to get there taking
into account the context and the company strategy

As a business partner, my role is:
- to be transparent on what we can/cannot deliver
- to be collaborative and approachable
- to build a reliable and trustworthy relationship
- to deliver a good outcome

## Expectations (my and yours)
**Best effort**. I trust and expect you to give your best effort and version on the job. I do the same. We all have different days. Some just don't work out. That's OK. Please expect that we can work together to have a reasonable workload and deadlines considering the time to take care of yourself. If you cannot give the best of yourself for any reason, I would be happy to discuss this and find ways forward.

**Setting expectations**. I do my best to communicate the importance, context and desired outcome and allow you to find out what works best for you and the team.

**Bias for action**. I support healthy ambition, proactiveness and initiative. According to the book "Decisive: How to Make Better Decisions" by Chip and Dan Heath, most of our decisions are easily reversible. In software engineering, it's very true. An environment of experimentation and learning from mistakes is important. Good decisions consider wider context, goals and constraints. My role is to enable this. I am accountable for my decisions and expect the same from the team.

**Stick to promises**. If I see risks in delivering a promise, I will let you know in advance. I expect the same from the team. Things may not go as planned. We are humans and sometimes tend to overcommit (including myself). The key is how we handle and communicate our challenges.

**Mutual help and support**. If you are stuck, just reach out. If I am not available for any reason, I will let you know why and when I am available. Help me to understand the urgency of the issue by describing the impact. There can be truly urgent things. For those, let's agree on the communication channels and SOPs in advance. Ideally, those should not be managed manually/ depend on someone's immediate presence. I expect **high collaboration and mutual support** in the team and between the teams. I like to say: there is no my or your work. There is our work! And we are in the same boat: we all either reach the shore or sink.

**No "Surprises"**. I prefer you bring up issues sooner. It would give time for mitigation. If this is your area of responsibility, I expect a plan of how you are handling it and what support (if any) is required. In any case, I want to avoid hearing bad news about our product or the team from external people, e.g. customers.

## The ways of work
If you come with a request, I appreciate your input, suggestions and questions. This is a good starting point for a discussion. I will ask questions to navigate our discussion. It's good when you bring 2-3 options for a solution, if possible. It would reduce my effort and become an exercise of validating the solutions rather than designing them. I might have less expertise in a topic than you. In this case, I avoid sharing my personal opinions.

For more complex decisions, I prefer to take time to think upfront before discussing where possible. This would increase the quality of the decision. If you write a short statement/ memo where you share the context and your thoughts, It would greatly help to prepare think about it properly. I like the asynchronous discussions around a shared document before jumping to a meeting. It helps t greatly reduce the discussion points.

I believe in the power of writing. When we write we consolidate and settle our thinking. I like writing memos when it comes to important decisions. Writing also greatly reduces the room for misinterpretation and miscommunication.

At times, I may ask managers to have an update in writing following a standard template. When I work with multiple work streams and teams a more structured approach works best for quality updates. It gives me the right information I need and enables me to be helpful in anything you need my attention.

If I ask multiple questions about your team, product, platform, or delivery typically it means I have a knowledge gap I need to address or I miss some important information. I try to avoid asking the questions that I can find answers for myself (e.g. dashboards or documentation). Please help me out and be patient if some questions sound silly or a bit scrutinizing.

I value in-person collaboration in the office. I believe the decision-making process is the fastest there. It's good to be together and build our culture. It's a good time to catch up with business stakeholders in person. I found pair programming an efficient collaborative technique. It may greatly improve team velocity.
At the same time, I value focus time and an opportunity to work remotely. Certain tasks require a destruction-free environment. A modern office is more prone to distractions. So hybrid setting would be the best mix addressing both needs.
 
### The power of feedback
I believe feedback is like a heartbeat. It's an essential part of our daily work. It should be given swiftly, clearly, and kindly. Any genuine feedback is good. It proves that someone cares and trusts. I value any feedback coming my way and would be happy to share mine.

I like to give feedback during 1:1s or when it's the right time. When I do it, I share specific examples of your behaviour I'd like to see more of. And any specific examples of your behaviour I'd like to see less of.

At times, I tend to forget about positive feedback and working to improve it. Sometimes, I ask you to write down what you are doing to help me out. It helps to recall the important and amazing work done and be an advocate of your work in the wider organisation.

### Meetings
I believe in having useful, short and productive meetings. I value my and your time and aim to start and finish them on time. The best meeting is in person. If not, video/audio would be my next preference. If I am in a meeting it means a) I need to know something important b) I am expected to provide input/advice/ support c) I am expected to participate in a decision making d) you want me to know something important.

If I see an invite with an unclear agenda/topic and I haven't got any context before I get upset and tempted to decline. The last thing I want to spend time in a meeting that is generally irrelevant or I could get a written update after. Or any surprise. I aim to be clear about the purpose of my meetings.

As far as ICs in my teams, I am an advocate of a focus time and would like to make sure formal meetings take minimum time (normally 10% or less) in a healthy team.

I expect you to be present in a meeting. If you are bored or feel excluded, it's a good thing to reflect on why and potentially discuss in 1:1. It could be a useless meeting or a problem of engagement, inclusion or anything else. 

For video calls, If you can, please use your camera. It enriches the quality of engagement and collaboration.

### 1:1s
It's our time to work together on your career. They are typically 30 min every week.
We can work together and tune the meeting to reflect your needs. I tend to offer to drive the agenda. I want to make sure you get the most out of this time.
I will use this meeting to give feedback, unblock you, work on your goals, and help with anything you need help with.

I propose to have a shared document where we both can put agendas and take notes/ action items. So we can remember what we worked on.
